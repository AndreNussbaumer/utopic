          When I read about Paganism, I feel they had a deeper connection to nature than we do now. It was like God wasn't separated from us, it lived in all which is natural. It lived in you, and lived in me. And that's why nature was so cherished. It's the forgotten elderly who carried an ancient knowledge we now find ourselves at straws to understand. I think the world needs a bit of Paganism, especially at this point, because there's nothing more important than nature. Nature can go on without men, but men can't go on without nature.

            <span class="articleBold">“Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as vital to nature." — <i>Marcus Aurelius</i></span>
          </p>
          I've been reading about Marcus Aurelius, and found out he 'ruled' during the Roman Pagan era. He was a follower of <b>stoicism</b>. I can't remember the last time I related so much to the writings of someone. The way he writes about nature is so humane, so hopeful and humble. Sometimes these kind of people make me question evolution, as if there's  an eternal pool of knowledge you can tap into, it's always there, in each and every star, and all you have to do is dream in order to revel in its wonders. It's truly incredible how these people lived thousands of years ago, yet they had a better insight than two thirds of the current population. How is that? Well, I could try to rationalize and explain, but stoicism taught me something, which is acceptance, and as such, I'm not going to try and figure out why, but rather enjoy these mysteries that fortunately leave open all the possibilities for life.
            <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">What about Christianity?</span>
            </p>
          Well, Christianity came and did an extremely good marketing campaign, which was, create Satan to the image of these Pagan Gods, and declare themselves the rulers of the spiritual world, for now if you worshipped these Gods, you were heretic and bound to suffer in eternal hell. Doesn't seem like a very pleasant <b>God</b> to be around. Doesn't seem very tolerant either, these surely seem more of mammal's traits than an all-knowing, divine one, I mean, personally I don't think the architect would be that limited, but what do I know. You see, Christianity has put a men above all else. It's only a man some of us worship, very ahead of his time, no doubt, due to his righteousness and benevolence, yet only a man. A savior, and indeed, we could save us from ourselves, if only we'd listen. But what would be of Christ without nature? I think he has a wonderful message, and many valuable lessons, but, those lessons were all said before by — Buddha, Lao Tzu, Confucius, Plato, Zarathrustra... as if all these messengers were nothing but a vassal of the conscience of the universe. As if nature spoke through them, as if it lived in them, as if it breath through them... I guess that's exactly the definition of a prophet.

              <span class="articleBolder">Conclusion</span>
            </p>
          Rome fell when it ceased to be a representative democracy and aimed to be an Empire.
          I'd even argue Rome fell when it ceased to be Pagan and decided to be Christian.
          This is why I think we need a bit of Paganism back in our lives, if we don't want our civilization to lose the aim of living an harmonious life in synthony with nature. With all that's beautiful,
          with all that's glorious, with all that's good.
