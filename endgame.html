          We've all witnessed where they are going, but, where is it, they want to arrive? An hyperbolic dystopian city where the few own everything whilst the most own nothing? What do they think will be the culmination of the perverse exploitation of our beautiful home? Or is it just the extinction of the poor? And I'm talking monetarily poor, because, as I see it, someone who profits off the misery of others are the poorest of them all. There's no other form of poverty for me, if not spiritually.

          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">Do they really think we aren't one in the same?</span>
          </p>

          Take for instance what's happening in <i>France</i>. What do you think would be the outcome? When these people and their countries have been neglected throughout their whole lives? We have to start to understand that we all share this planet, either we want it or not, and taking care of others, is indeed taking care of ourselves. No way what we did, and what we continue to do wouldn't have negative consequences that would in all sorts of ways react in the future against us. It's physics. For every action, there's a reaction. There's no way of escaping the laws of nature. We're not Gods. We're just human beings part of a once very diverse ecosystem. The right says these problems are due to immigration, always ignoring Capitalism, because well, the people who finance them are, you guessed it, ultra-capitalists. If we didn't destroy their ecosystems, such as in the <i>Niger Delta</i>, due to oil exploitation, thousands would have a home, and wouldn't have the need to migrate to different places since their livelihoods as fisherman and hunters wouldn't have been jeopardized. The same goes for mining, for the corrupt politicians we'd put in place that would legitimize the private corporations illegal actions, instead of developing infrastructure that would retain and give jobs for their own people. The Capital isn't interested in that, I mean, where would they get their modern slaves if African countries were doing good and were able to give dignifying jobs to their people? When they needed basic sanitation, the most efficient way to prevent the spread of diseases, what did they do? They sold them vaccines, knowing very well that it's the same as putting a band-aid on an infected wound. But, if they disinfected the wound from the get go, they couldn't possibly continue to profit, could they? The endgame of Capitalism isn't to stop the disease it has created, it is to perpetually spread to all organisms until it implodes on its empty excess.

          I do really want to understand the plan, it would make our whole lives easier, if we could only understand the plan, the trajectory their tracing, because as it looks, it seems like the dumbest shit even a 5 year old couldn't possibly come up with. Imagine ruining a paradise for a completely inflated currency in a digital system. This is perverse, this has to go deeper than a survival instinct you know. It has to do with evil, it has to, there's no other explanation for it. There's no logical nor reasonable explanation for what they do, and what they stand for. We live in a finite planet, we should be striving for more sustainable ways of living, and not dive deeper in intensive agriculture and inhumane capitalist practices. But we're not, we're causing more damage when we should be delivering healing. We can all see it's not going to end well. But why can't they see it? Or do they know, but they understand that the change in the way we live our lives means a change in the system, which will inevitably overthrow their criminal institutions that got them rich in the first place?
