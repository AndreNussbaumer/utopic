        The world is going through an extraordinary crisis. The old ways of the past haven't been able to adapt to the new ways of the future. Our society, for everything it is, and everything it stands for, hasn't been able to withstand our technological and philosophical progress, which means, something's got to give. Because the system we live in is rather inflexible and inorganic, it has destroyed most of the splendorous variety organisms found to organize themselves throughout the world. This is not only an economic crisis, it's also a spiritual one. It's a fight over a materialistic society the elites have projected on to the world of what they truly care for, against all that is immaterial. That's why people are setting 'things' on fire. It's a burning poem. I obviously condemn such actions as I don't think that alone will serve any good, help the cause or  solve the problem, but when the universal voice is smothered by those who are conformed with the current status-quo of the world, obviously that voice will make sure it's heard through deeds. The universal voice becomes a universal will, and there's not much that can go against the universal will, for it's the strongest force this universe will ever know. Doesn't matter how much it ages, doesn't matter how much it wrinkles, it will always reach beyond itself. Doesn't matter how much it is stamped on, it will always stand up. Doesn't matter how many times it is killed, it'll reborn. Doesn't matter how many times it is forgotten, it'll always be remembered. This is the fight of our times, to part ways with the old that has been stalling our ways of progress for far too long now. Because the only interest the capital has now is to conserve its hegemony, it won't focus on how to improve humanity's life. Its goal now is mainly to survive, and when we're in survival mode, bad things happen. When we're in fear, our true primitive nature shows. It's time to become citizens of the world, an united front, much like the capital has, that isn't bound by nationality. Don't forget, that whatever we'll do, we'll forever be remembered, be it silence, or courage.
