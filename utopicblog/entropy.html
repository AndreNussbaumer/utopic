            The siren signals the beginning of something wonderful. Before, the sky was
            starless, well, there was no sky to be honest since there wasn't an atmosphere.
            Everything is starting to unravel into <a href="#"></a> beautiful masterpiece. Soon comes the chants
            of forgotten templars sitting around a table in a dark dungeon. It's coming to light,
            and the exotic rhythms take you for a ride, depicting the name of the album in its entirety,

           A very well put bridge in Lonely Man, where the silence in the wisdom of the owls
           along with the loud laughs of insanity, carries the best and worst in humanity,
           and all of this, at the tip of your ears.
           The mind races striving for more, and as you look at the artwork while listening to it,
           it somehow moves as if it's looking for something in the hidden frequency, the source of
           the being. The night driver, is indeed looking for something.
           Entropy might be my favorite song in the album, because the music itself sort of tells
           everything I've already written, there is a boy who doesn't think of anything bad for
           the world is a reflection of who he is, innocent, and the ending part, for me, somehow
           represents the ritual passage into adulthood.
           The Event Horizon is probably the most progressive song in the album, the piano along with
           the crying guitar makes it one of a kind, as if these two instruments were talking to one
           another, delivering amazing symphonic arguments, growing into a sad yet hopeful medley,
           never returning to its initial state, but growing, and growing, into a peaceful haven,
           the calm before the storm, where everything is one, and one is everything.
           And there comes the storm, the chaos, but it's not the chaos that you might've thought where
           a cacophony of destruction prevails, but a beautiful chaos where the creative force abounds
           and excels beyond the fingers of João Santos.
           The last song embraces you and slowly lets you know that the journey is coming to an end,
           like a long night, where the moon slowly vanishes, and it's day again.
           A well conceived piece of art, where only two songs have lyrics, yet  the whole album seems
           to be speaking to us at all times.
