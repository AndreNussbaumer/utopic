          What should the new generation of gaming look like, and why we have to move on to something better.

          In my opinion, the early stages of gaming was a discovery. These are the times when possibilities are limitless. These are the times of creativity, when a new way is found. There wasn't really any other purpose to them, if not to put ourselves up to the test of creating an interactive experience that would engage millions worldwide.

          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="bolder">So, what happened?</span>
          </p>


          Right now games are built around creating profit, and not in what they initially stood for, that was, the discovery, the fun aspect of creating things. The business model comes before the game itself, thus leading to a rather purposeless and tasteless experience.
          At this point in time there's a thing that bothers me immensely. Each time I play a game for 20 minutes, I feel as if it was just time wasted. And for a good reason. You see, the time you spend on a game nowadays can be capitalized. The time that you are connected to such application is being monetized, so, in a sense, you're not only wasting money buying superfluous cosmetics in the games you play, but you're also wasting time. So, how do we get around this problem and make the gaming experience more rewarding and dignifying of our time and worth as human beings?


          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">Well, we create games that not only entertain us, but teach us something, be it in science, physics, biology or electronic circuits, the games we consume should offer more beyond their beautiful graphics and playability.</span>
          </p>


          Right now we can all concur that most of the entertainment we consume isn't just innocent entertainment. It carries an agenda that will be tweaked until it resonates not with their creators, but those who fund it. Yeah, it lacks the fun part. I mean, that's why there are people funding it right, they want their money back. That's generally my feeling towards the modern gaming industry, they're mainly taking, and not giving. One can say that I'm being entertained, but not even that much anymore. Now, if I'm learning and improving myself by spending money and time on such applications, then I'll feel better about myself. I'll feel as if my time wasn't wasted. How do we implement a fun way of learning and teaching people about a veriety of subjects? Every game has its own learning curve, the best are rather simple and thats why you are lured to them. By their simplistic nature. Nature tends to think in simple terms, sometimes. It chooses the easiest path. If there are particles in a windshield making it harder for a rain droplet to progress in a linear pattern then that rain droplet will change its trajectory and flow through where it requires less energy. We are the same way. Most of us are attracted by the easiest jobs available. Our brain as a self defense mechanism is glad to help you choosing that which requires the less effort, so, we'll choose the games that require less effort for us. The same goes for a TV Show, or Music. After a hard days work, the last thing I want is to actually think. This sounds like a paradox, creating games that are hard. They don't have to be hard. Physics, biology and electrical circuits don't have to be hard, in fact they can be easy to teach and easy to learn. My main concern is that too much superfluous and empty entertainment will lead to a superfluous society, which, i'm afraid is what we're all experiencing now. Do you remember how games were so awesome before? What happened? Have I outgrown them, or they lost something along the way? A purpose? A meaning for their existence?

          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">Creating products that are money making machines are the complete opposite of the word fun. The mentality that products must profit is acting against the magic surrounding life. Where's all the magic, I ask? Why does this world keeps getting less magical every day? I guess that even magic has bills to pay.</span>
