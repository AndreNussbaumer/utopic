        We were going from city to city fixing lamps. There was music playing on the background. A kid sat in a pond surrounded by tadpoles that had stings. He was lost and we helped
        him find his way back home. When we arrived his mother greeted and thanked us and asked if she could tag along. We said yes. I remember she had burn scars in her arm.

        I was going through a corridor with a lot of doors and suddenly got attacked by a sasquatch which was a friend of mine who hadn't taken care of himself for a long time. I laughed,
        but his family whom were sitting by looked very concerned. They said: He does that to everyone which is not normal. Then he attacked me again but couldn't hit me. I woke up
        thinking about a tourniquet.

        I was on this warehouse and someone had packs of pistachios stacked. I took some. Pretty sure there was a backstory to this but I don't remember. He told me they were 2300â‚¬ a kilo.
        I said that everything was expensive nowadays. Then we helped an old lady making purchases online. Behind us there was a guy playing a game with some girl
        sitting next to him reading a book.
        I asked him if he had her number. He said he didn't know how. I asked the girl if she knew how to make online purchases.

        I was ridding on a kind of a zeppelin and remember to tell her to mind the cables. I can't really make out how the plane looked, it was weird. Then a guy with a tie and a suit
        asked us where Manchester was. We said we weren't from there. She was trying to give him directions, so I asked if it was like a private club. He said yes. I don't remember much
        else, most of the dream was flying in this weird plane in a crowded city, avoiding all the electricity cables.

        I was on my way to a terrace to have dinner and meet a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. She was sitting on her car. She got out and as we spoke she was playing with a dog
        that somehow managed to bit her finger. I gave a yucca branch to the dog for him to chew and a guy close by said I shoudn't because the fibers would hurt his stomach. I said:
        Okay, and went to the terrace party. My friend said she used to go there as a kid and didn't like the place. I said that when we were kids we don't know how to appreciate
        the good things. I remember stepping on a bracelet made of beads and breaking it. There was a poster of a guy on the walls named Jacob who was a prysbetarian, whatever that meant.

      <div id="beach" class="dreamText">
        I was at some sort of beach with my father. I don't know why but I needed to know the prices to stay. He was talking about why didn't they just fix it somewhere. I said it's
        no big deal, I'll just climb the hill and ask them. Suddenly there was an unbearable stench because a spaceship had crashed with kettle inside. Someone said: I hope they don't open
        it and just ship it back to where it came from. I went to check it out. When I arrived it was empty inside. There was no way out, if not for a sink with two handles for water and
        a pipe. All I can remember is that I was back at my house on the country side and lots of planes started to bomb it. I remember the house was empty with no furniture, then I
        encountered a man with a moustache as I was running inside. The walls and ceiling grew as I got smaller. I dunno where I got the plank from which I was trying to hit the man I
        encountered with. I couldn't hit him. I looked behind to see if his friends were coming for me and that's when I woke up.
