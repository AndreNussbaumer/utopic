         </p>
            The unnatural selection is what the dominant classes have been perpetrating throughout the globe, which is the constant persecution and consequent destruction of
            left leaning people. Not only they are persecuted, but replaced, with a fake 'left' of neoliberals which their only purpose is to make sure that Capitalism stays
            the gift that keeps on taking.
          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">How?</span>
          </p>
            Before the strategy was pretty clear, infiltrate the governing bodies of sovereign countries that were getting 'friendly' with socialist ideals, overthrow their democratically elected officials and plant dictators who'd persecute the left while catering to the interests of the nation and corporations who helped them with the coup d'etat. A win-win situation, for the few, of course. The rest of the world would lose, because every time progress is stalled, humanity loses. That's what happened with Vitor Jara, for instance, when Pinochet, with the help of the U.S, unconstitutionally overthrew Allende's government and started to persecute the thinkers, artists and poets. This was called the Operation Condor. Brazil was also a target in the Operation Brother Sam, when the U.S helped install the Brazilian dictatorship. You can already start to understand how the unnatural selection works, and why the places we live are becoming literal hells. It's because of an imbalanced system, and imbalanced systems create imbalanced societies which in turn create imbalanced human beings.
            <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">This is why it seems there's more bad things happening than good. Because Capitalism enabled the unnatural selection, choosing who's worthy and who's not, and naturally, those worthy to Capitalists are soulless, unethical and immoral grifters who will willingly sell their brothers to protect the interests of their masters. There's a reason why senior executives are more likely to show psychopathic traits.</span>
            </p>
            The good one's keep getting destroyed while the bad one's grow uncontrollably and make up for the most part of our world. Hence the world you live in now.
            As long as good people keep fighting for this natural progress of a fair distribution and allocation of resources with those who comprise our communities, good people will be persecuted. Good people will be hated. Good people will be painted as bad, because <b>evil</b> hates everything <b>good</b> in us.

            Now, before you say this is only natural selection at work and the fascists keep winning because they're stronger, you've missed the point. The night of the long knives didn't represent who was stronger, just represented who was more of a coward. Assassinating people who are in their beds asleep isn't an act of bravery or strength, it's an act of cowardly dogs. It takes much more to be good, than it takes to be bad.
            <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">The easy path, usually descends into darkness, while the hard path, usually ascends into light. This means that it's easier to <b>hate</b> than it is to <b>love</b> . It's easier to destroy than it is to build.</span>
