<b>So,</b> who was right, and who was wrong all along? Maybe we were all wrong. Maybe that's the presupposition we must go from, at least the healthiest. More division? More erosion? Like the culmination of an amazing plot where everything goes to hell? We should be telling a different story. We were all wrong. No doubt about it. But certain feelings allowed and legitimized some wrongs to be right. Such as greed. Primitive feelings that enabled us to go back to the start. Afraid of not being able to survive with the little we hold inside. Afraid of not being accepted, of not belonging. They reach up to the skies and firmly believe in god, but that god they believe in apparently isn't bound to this world. It's bound to a different one.

              Let's start with the individualization that Capitalism has brought upon our society. You know, I see life as a continuous building block, assimilating different ideas and concept into a much stronger one. That's what nature has been doing all along. You might have individual struggles and motives to do what you must, but in the end, those struggles and motives were also born out of the collective experience. Let's take for instance a very bright individual who has a children. Let's say that his children isn't bound to a collective progress but rather an individual one, and that this individual can do better than ten which don't come from such bright parents. I can tell you if we teach that kid to live in a forest and then allow him to prosper and come up with inventions, the best he will be able to come up with is probably primitive tools to help him hunt, if that, at all. All the discoveries and all the knowledge imagined by billions who came before us is what allow us to come up with what we come up with, so, it's not much of an individual realization as it is a collective. Like a tree, the roots are truly important and so it's the bark to protect its 'vitals' from the environment, yet, its fruits and flowers wouldn't be possible if not for the sun nor the water.
          </p>
          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">Why does this matter?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Capitalism keeps selling us this idea that the individual is paramount when the individual in reality is nothing. We're not that important. We're just part of something bigger. It sold us the idea that everyone needed a car, when what we truly needed was a competent public transportation that would connect the whole world. But that, doesn't align with the interest of the individual, does it? How is that profitable? We must be making cars every god damn second, right? I mean, it's great we have them and we invented it, but it's not sustainable, I mean, even when every single one of them become electric, what will you do with the other billions already running around? What will you do with the tires that the new electric ones need? In the long run, all of this doesn't make much sense, it only makes sense in the short run, which is how the capitalist mentality works, the least time, the most profit. They want short-term profits, not long-term, because why would a self-centered individual care about the influence he had on earth after he's gone?

          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBolder">Why were things done this way?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom line is profit. But not only. So, we spoke about how the individualization leads to more sales, but, we haven't spoken in the power of having a fragmented society. How does this fragment our society?  Because the more individualized our society becomes, the less united and the less powerful, so these corporations, such as Apple, are not only providing a service to the community, but are now subconsciously dividing the people through the items they sell. This is how the capital has been able to turn us against each other, it's not only an ideological battle, it goes much deeper than that. It's not by chance that you have an Iphone. It's me, I. The I it's a phallic symbol. And is somehow an extension of the individual. Most of our design philosophy is now supportive of this system of individualization, such as Instagram. These products are no longer designed to bring the best in each one of us, but the worst. That is a problem. The one's investing billions in such products couldn't care less for the collective progress. Couldn't care less for the damage it creates in perpetuity. Couldn't care less for art or poetry. All they care for its currency, which enables them to sustain and increase the vast amount of power they already hold.
            <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">What now?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              When someone says that it's the will of god, or that it's destiny, tell them that it was engineered and nothing but the will of men. Now that we are aware of the implications that having humanity answer to nothing more other than currency we shall create things differently, because having a society that places private propriety above human sanctity is a really, really trash society. It's an inhumane society. A society ruled by materialistic expression. Yeah, it does sounds like a god-damn nightmare, but hey, here we are.
