            To put it simply, Capitalism needs companies to be held privately for profit in order to funnel those profits to a couple of individuals, who in turn, will spend it in businesses that align with their interests while generating more profits, hence sustaining and expanding their hegemony. It's not sustainable, and it creates an imbalance. The very essence of left-wing idealism goes against that idea, which needs companies to be held collectively in order to funnel the resources back to the whole and not the individual, keeping society balanced, from collapsing as a whole.

            <span class="articleBolder">Adam Smith said: "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."  </span>
          </p>
          Obviously this is not entirely true, and it's very linear given the complexity and ambiguity in mankind. With over eight billion people walking this earth, it's a rather homogeneous thinking for such a diverse life, but, somehow they were able to subvert most of us into that ideology, selfish people who are only looking out for their own big fat bellies.  I mean, think about it. The world we live in now is nothing but a reflection of that philosophy. Almost everyone fencing for themselves. Almost everyone thinking solely about their self interest and not what our communities need, or what the environment needs. Honestly, with such approach to life, there couldn't be any other outcome if not the reality we live in now.
          Capitalism clearly glorifies greed. I mean, honestly, how could someone put profits above nature? Really, what kind of soulless fucktard goes and say: Hey guys, the numbers in my bank account are more important than that which keep us all alive. Jesus fucking Christ.
            <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">But, when did this greed start, where does it come from?</span>
            </p>
            I theorize that greed came with the fact that we became sedentary. When we were a hunter-gatherer society, we couldn't store as we were constantly traveling. Luggage slowed us down. We couldn't carry a lot of things. There wasn't an abundance, so people couldn't be greedy because if someone was, he'd be ostracized due to the fact that wanting more for you meant less for the others, and in a tribal setting this could jeopardize their effectiveness and if they weren't effective, they'd all eat less each time, which meant extinction in the long run. Here you can already see how sustainability works. So, collaboration was the key for their survival, and not because everyone fenced for themselves. When we settled and started to practice agriculture and got very good at it, we started to generate a surplus though, that surplus could be expropriated by someone, someone who feared of not being able to go through the winter, and out of that fear,  started to take more for himself, to make sure he'd survive. Today there's no such thing as fear of not being able to go through a winter. Greed is solely a moral and ethical stance, and as I see it, purely evil.
            No rational or logical thought can explain the need for an individual to have billions in a bank account, albeit being mostly an illusion.
            In today's world, billions in a single bank account means thousands in multiple bank accounts, so that prevents others from not only being economically independent,
            but also active members of creating better communities.

              <span class="articleBolder">Conclusion</span>
            </p>

            Left-wing ideals are humanistic in nature, something Capitalism doesn't promote at all. The disregard towards the financial emancipation of others show how inhumane it actually is. The exploitation of the land, our civilizational heirloom, to maximize gains for a few individuals in an unsustainable and perverse way is anti-nature. The belief that the capital is above human sanctity, is not and will never be a left-wing ideal. The fact that Capitalism and it's social structure is a hierarchical pyramid scheme is the opposite of an egalitarian society, which are at the core of left-wing idealism. The fact that Capitalism measures the worth of people by their wealth instead of achievement. The constant censorship in Capitalist media owned versus the free-speech the left-wing has been fighting for so long. For all these reasons, Capitalism, can't ever, and will never be, left-wing, for if you believe in Capitalism, then you believe in a world filled with masters and slaves, idols, greed, consumers, a gray corporate world ruled by economists, corruption, sabotage, war, misery, diseases and famine, this is what the imbalance perpetrated by a Capitalist society creates, and it's all around for us to see.
