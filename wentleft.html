           I started to read a lot of books about biology, to understand more about life and everything surrounding me. I think that to make educated choices we must first know their underlying implications. In this incessant search for meaning at a cellular level, I found some patterns. Now I tend to look at society as an organism, as a whole, and my observations is that I'm living in a very extreme one. Extreme riches, extreme poverty. Extreme weather. Extreme technology, and extreme vanity. Extremely full yet extremely empty. This, in my opinion, is Capitalism in a nutshell. The right. A system of extremes. A system of all or nothing. A system that didn't allow for diversity to flourish amidst all its lies so we as scientific humans could observe and identify the ways of life that serves us better. How, you may ask? By acting like a cancer. Cancer cells ignore the signals sent by the organism to terminate themselves, and so they start to multiply uncontrollably. To feed their caustic cause they sabotage the resources around them. Can be translated as lobbying. With its system in place and not answering to no one, they grow until the imbalance becomes to big for the organism to work.  It's not flexible. It's not willing to open itself to different ways of living. Whatever it's not organic, I tend to see as somewhat unnatural, because life adapts and it's always finding new ways, like rivers, like trees growing tall in canopies reaching for the clouds. On the other hand, I found that the left is looking forward to create a homeostasis, which is, a balance in our system that allow us to live on, allow us to regenerate and to process energy. That balance which the left is so determined to fight for can be seen in its belief of wealth redistribution, which seems to me a much more healthy way of doing things, because that's what nature has been doing for billions of years. It has been finding the balance to be able to multiply itself and to create better systems in order to evolve. That manifestation I've observed in nature is a telling that we should sober up on the way we're looking at life. We're losing that touch to the natural. With an increasingly robotic society it's only natural for that to happen. With fake TV shows, fake celebrities, fake politicians, our lives are becoming themselves fake. We somehow can no longer tell right from wrong.
