          It denounces and exposes in a subliminal way the horrors of war. It has so much more content than its competitor, that was Saving Private Ryan, which took all the merit away from this masterpiece by alluding to a broader audience with everything that The Thin Red Line rejected in its premise, such as glorification of war, patriotism and nationalistic fever, empty explosions.

         When I was younger I loved Saving Private Ryan, especially because I used to play MoH:AA, and the sceneries covered in the movie were the same as the ones I was playing in with my crew, but now that I'm older, I can distinguish the clear gap of philosophical and artistic expressions between the two. One is a product of propaganda designed to empower the allies, while the other is an artistic form that questions the war, poses questions about human nature and existence through all the different characters that hold different opinions and beliefs of what war really is. It even explores the natives and their simplistic way of life detached from all of that which they were killing for. I enjoyed its truthfulness in portraying fights between those tribes. Nothing's a paradise, there will always be differences of opinion and struggles for hierarchic power, but we must remember and relearn diplomacy before war.
