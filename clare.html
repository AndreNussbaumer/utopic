There’s only a handful of politicians I can relate to nowadays, maybe because politics no longer stand for what they once stood, as I see it, politics became a business, an organization that places the interests of corporations above the interests of the nation and the people they ought to represent. But it’s only natural for that to happen, Marx predicted that everything under a Capitalist system eventually becomes a commodity, and politics were no exception.
          <p id="articleSpace">
            <span class="articleBold">This lead to a lot of politicians without a voice, a will, a soul if you may, for their only job is to implement the laws that benefit the corporations who finance them. </span>
          </p>
 It seems that the Governments no longer trace the plans. They are nothing but a middle-man who legitimizes and supports the private to shape not only the economy, but also the culture that will help to progress their industries. It seems like most of them are simply grifters, tools who are disposed and forgotten once their job is done. However, <b>Clare Daly</b> seems to be one of the few who isn’t scared to say the truth. Isn’t scared to go against the grain. Maybe it’s an inherited struggle from her ancestors, because in a historical context, the Irish have always been rebellious, and rebellion only happens when there’s something to rebel against, which usually are unjust empires, unjust laws and unjust treatment. Organisms are always looking for a balance, so obviously if there’s an imbalance in let’s say wealth, status or even morality, you can be sure those organisms will fight to stabilize things, for stability is what allows for all that’s good to flourish. It’s not by chance that the periods of great achievements were done in periods of peace and stability. Wars which leads to stress and in turn high levels of cortisol are scientifically proven to impair memory and reasoning, rendering politicians like <b>Clare Daly</b> an important equalizer in an industry that is becoming increasingly polarized given that there’s no money to be made when protecting the interests and the rights of those who have little to nothing. As the imbalances become more prominent, the catalyzers whom seek stability shine like gold among the rubble, as if a literal breath of fresh air in the vast desert of what the perilous quest for power becomes.
    <p id="articleSpace">
              <span class="articleBolder">I hope Clare Daly keeps standing up and speaking for the underdogs, for the oppressed and against the oppressors who are in a constant war against themselves, rendering them active enemies of mankind. </span>
