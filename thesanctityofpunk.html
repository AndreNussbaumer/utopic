         Punks are the monks born under the capitalist sun. The wanderers who came from unloving homes. It's not by chance they wear metal studded jackets and liberty spikes, no, it's because they've grown up in harsh environments, and much like beautiful flowers, they grow thorns to protect themselves. Roses do that, for instance. It's an evolutionary trait, and unconsciously we might do the same that nature has been doing since the beginning of times. We're just its reflection. Maybe we're just nature discovering itself through each and every one of us? Through every body, every chord, every phrase, every poem, every painting... A record of who she is? A photograph of herself?

         The sanctity in punk, the spirituality in it, we can say that it's counter-intuitive because, no gods, no masters, but spirituality isn't really about god. Or maybe it's solely about god. I don't think punk has a problem with spirituality. punk has a problem with religion. Religion isn't the same as spirituality. Religion is basically the business of spirituality. And that's what punk doesn't like about it. It's labeling a transcendental experience. Selling it. Punk in itself is a very spiritual thing, in my opinion. It's almost like the Sadhus in India who pierce themselves and shock the tourists.

         Because of the extreme consumerism that came with a capitalist society, a more ascetic mentality was bound to be brought to light. That was punk. A way of life that most of us joined for all the wrong reasons, but ended up staying for the right ones. A resistance to the excessive ways Capitalism was trying to instill in all of us, because, there's no capitalism without consumerism. A voice rose through the feedback of broken amplifiers. It was punk rock. A cry against Governments. I'm not gonna lie, it had a big impact on me while growing up, and I did turn against the Government, but now I understand that my angst wasn't directed at a lawfully and democratically elected party looking out for the best of the citizens they represent, but rather corruption. Now I understand that the corruption comes from the Capitalist thirst of our new found faith, that is, currency. Money. Have we all been corrupted? Or is it our nature? Is nature corrupted? How can that be, if we're here? If we made it this far? There has to be more good than bad in each one of us. If not we'd have been long gone. To fight against this instantaneous pleasures, punk developed a do-it-yourself mentality which could almost relate to the work ethics of monasteries. Now you wouldn't just buy things and consume directly, but take the time to learn how to create them. For those who thought punk was a simple display of fashion, couldn't find more about themselves in that statement. You see, what we think and what we say, usually tells more about ourselves than of what we're talking about.

            <span class="articleBolder">Punk is a breakthrough from the material straight into the soul. It makes you grateful for what you've got. Makes you appreciate the little things. It makes you be grateful for the miracle that is life, and to stand up for what's right.</span>
